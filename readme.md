# Docker-compose files for setting up a home media server

I prefer to manage these ymls through **Portainer**.

This will allow you to setup **Sonarr**, **Radarr**, **Overseerr** and **Plex** for a home media server.

**Qbittorent** and **Jackett** are configured to pass their traffic through a VPN connection using **gluetun**.
